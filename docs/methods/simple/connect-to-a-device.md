# Connect to a Device

One of the first steps you need to carry to leverage the API is to connect to one device. This library offers you ways to find one or multiple devices connected to your local network. See below the different ways to connect to a device:

=== "Discover One Device"

    Using the [`discover_one_device()`][pupil_labs.realtime_api.simple.discover_one_device], you will get access to the first device it detects.

    ```py title="discover_devices.py" linenums="0" hl_lines="4"
    --8<-- "examples/simple/discover_devices.py:1:2,4:5"
    ```

=== "Discover Multiple Devices"

    Using the [`discover_devices()`][pupil_labs.realtime_api.simple.discover_devices], you can connect to more than one device.

    ```py title="discover_devices.py" linenums="0" hl_lines="4"
    --8<-- "examples/simple/discover_devices.py:1:2,8:9"
    ```

=== "Connect Directly via IP Address"

    There might be instances where devices can't be found due to the network, but you can always specify the IP address and port to simplify the process.

    ```py linenums="0" hl_lines="4-5"
    from pupil_labs.realtime_api.simple import Device

    # This address is just an example. Find out the actual IP address of your device!
    ip = "192.168.1.169"
    device = Device(address=ip, port="8080")
    ```

Make sure the Companion App is running! If no device can be found, please have a look at the [troubleshooting section](../../troubleshooting.md).

Below you can find a link to the full code example and the API referece for the returned Device object.

## Device Information & Automatic Status Updates

Once connected, the [`Device`][pupil_labs.realtime_api.simple.Device] object provides access to various properties of the Companion Device or glasses, such as [battery level][pupil_labs.realtime_api.simple.Device.battery_level_percent], [free storage][pupil_labs.realtime_api.simple.Device.memory_num_free_bytes], or the [serial numbers][pupil_labs.realtime_api.simple.Device.module_serial] of connected components.

This class, will automatically monitor Neon / Pupil Invisible Companion's Device in the background and mirror its state accordingly.

=== "Get a snap of Status"

    ```python title="get_status.py" linenums="0"
    --8<-- "examples/simple/get_status.py"
    ```
    ```py title="Output" linenums="0"
    Phone IP address: 192.168.1.168
    Phone name: OnePlus8
    Battery level: 43%
    Free storage: 92.4 GB
    Serial number of connected glasses: h4gcf
    ```

=== "Continuously monitor Status Updates"

    ```python linenums="0"
    --8<-- "examples/simple/status_auto_update.py"
    ```

    ```title="Output" linenums="0"
    Looking for the next best device...
    Scene camera connected: True
    (Dis)connect the scene camera and hit enter...
    Scene camera connected: False
    ```
