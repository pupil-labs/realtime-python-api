### Scene Camera Video

It's very easy to stream the scene camera feed with timestamps for real-time monitoring. Simply use the
[`device.receive_scene_video_frame`][pupil_labs.realtime_api.simple.Device.receive_scene_video_frame] method.

```py linenums="0"
bgr_pixels, frame_datetime = device.receive_scene_video_frame()
```

<figure markdown="span">
![Scene camera](../../../assets/scene.webp){ width=500,loading=lazy }
</figure>

??? quote "SimpleVideoFrame"

    ::: pupil_labs.realtime_api.simple.SimpleVideoFrame

??? example "Check the whole example code here"

    ```py title="stream_scene_camera_video.py" linenums="1"
    --8<-- "examples/simple/stream_scene_camera_video.py"
    ```

### Scene Camera Video with Overlaid Gaze

For additional context about where the wearer was gazing, it's useful to overlay gaze measurements onto the scene
camera video stream. Since the scene camera and gaze signal can have different sampling rates, we need to be sure they
are matched. For that, you can use ([`device.receive_matched_scene_video_frame_and_gaze`][pupil_labs.realtime_api.simple.Device.receive_matched_scene_video_frame_and_gaze]).
This receives a pair of scene camera video and gaze data already matched.

```py linenums="0"
frame, gaze = device.receive_matched_scene_video_frame_and_gaze()
```

<figure markdown="span">
![Scene camera with gaze overlay](../../../assets/matched.webp){  width=500,loading=lazy }
</figure>

    ```

### Scene Camera Video with Overlayed Eyes Video and Gaze Circle

It might also be useful to overlay the eye camera video frames, e.g. if you want to manually inspect the eye data or
blinking behaviour. This can be achieved using the
[`device.receive_matched_scene_and_eyes_video_frames_and_gaze`][pupil_labs.realtime_api.simple.Device.receive_matched_scene_and_eyes_video_frames_and_gaze]
method.

```py linenums="0"
matched = device.receive_matched_scene_and_eyes_video_frames_and_gaze()
```

<figure markdown="span">
![Scene camera with gaze and eyes overlay](../../../assets/triplet.webp){  width=500,loading=lazy }
</figure>

<!-- ### Scene Camera Video with Overlayed Fixations

Although there is no convenient method to receive a matched scene camera video with fixation data, here is an example of
how you can implement it yourself.

    ```py title="stream_video_with_overlayed_fixations.py" linenums="1"
