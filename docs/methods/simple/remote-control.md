With the device connected, you can remotely control your [device][pupil_labs.realtime_api.simple.Device], similarly to the [Monitor App](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/neon/data-collection/monitor-app/) and start, stop, save and annotate recordings.

## Start a Recording

It is possible to remotely control your [device][pupil_labs.realtime_api.simple.Device].
Use [`device.recording_start`][pupil_labs.realtime_api.simple.Device.recording_start] to start a recording on the device
and return the recording ID.

```py linenums="0" title="start_stop_recordings.py"
--8<-- "examples/simple/start_stop_recordings.py:12:13"
```

```linenums="0"
Started recording with id 54e7d0bb-5b4c-40e6-baed-f2e11eb4f53b
```

## Stop & Save a Recording

You can stop and save a recording using [`device.recording_stop_and_save`][pupil_labs.realtime_api.simple.Device.recording_stop_and_save].
Note that if you have a mandatory question that is not filled, the recording will not be saved until that question is answered.

```py linenums="0" title="start_stop_recordings.py"
--8<-- "examples/simple/start_stop_recordings.py:24:24"
```

```linenums="0"
Recording stopped and saved
```

## Cancel a Recording

You can also cancel ([`device.recording_cancel`][pupil_labs.realtime_api.simple.Device.recording_cancel]) a recording if
you don't want to save it, just be aware that this will delete the recording and all its data.

```py linenums="0" title="start_stop_recordings.py"
device.recording_cancel()
```

## Save Events

A common requirement is to save [events](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/neon/data-collection/events/) with your recording.
This is made possible using the [`device.send_event`][pupil_labs.realtime_api.simple.Device.send_event] method. By default, the Neon device receiving the event will assign a timestamp to it, using the time of arrival. Optionally, you can set a custom nanosecond timestamp for your event instead. We also show you how to measure the clock offset between the Neon device and client computer, which may be useful for synchronising third-party clocks with your Neon device.

=== "Timestamped on Arrival (Host/Companion Device)"

    ```py linenums="0" title="send_event.py"
    --8<-- "examples/simple/send_event.py:12:12"
    ```
    ```py linenums="0"
    Event(name=None recording_id=None timestamp_unix_ns=1744271292116000000 datetime=2025-04-10 09:48:12.116000)
    ```

=== "With Explicit Timestamp"

    ```py linenums="0" title="send_event.py"
    --8<-- "examples/simple/send_event.py:14:19"
    ```
    ```py linenums="0"
    Event(name=None recording_id=None timestamp_unix_ns=1744271291692745000 datetime=2025-04-10 09:48:11.692745)
    ```

=== "With Manual Clock Offset Correction"

    ```py linenums="0" title="send_event.py"
    --8<-- "examples/simple/send_event.py:22:36"
    ```
    ```py linenums="0"
    Clock offset: -437_790_000 ns
    Event(name=None recording_id=None timestamp_unix_ns=1744271293119536000 datetime=2025-04-10 09:48:13.119536)
    ```

Events will **only** be saved if a recording is running. If you send an event while the Companion app is not recording, it will be discarded.

!!! info "Event's name"

    Even though the returned `Event.name` is None, the name is being acknowledged by the device.
    TODO:  Ask if we want to return it even though is not being returned in the response.

### Check for Errors

You can also monitor the recording for potential errors. Add the [`device.get_errors`][pupil_labs.realtime_api.simple.Device.get_errors] method to your code to get notified of errors (if they happen) during your recording.
